## Online game like the Countdown gameshow but with IPA symbols and phonetic transcriptions

IPA countdown is a game I developed using Shiny R, essentially replicating the [famous British TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_%28game_show%29) in which contestants have to form words from a set of randomly selected letters. The key difference? In IPA countdown, youâ€™re using IPA symbols to put together phonemic transcriptions rather than orthographic representations. I think this is a really good resource for students, particularly undergraduates who are learning the IPA chart for the first time in introductory phonetics classes.
